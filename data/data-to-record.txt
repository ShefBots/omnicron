This is a list of experiments to perform with the robot to record some useful data for traditional CV methods:

### Test Runs for SLAM algorithm test:
  - driving around and inbetween barrels
    - one with the robot's yaw fixed to one orientation
    - one where the robot actually rotates around, free-drive style
    - fast and slow variants of the two above
  - driving around with a minesweeper square on the floor somewhere (can be fast and slow)

These will be used to test a basic bitmap-based implementation of SLAM for better barrel placement in the navigation
map. Might also try another direct-distance algorithm, but I think that'll be a bit pants.

It will also allow for porting of the original minesweeper algorithm to the 360 cam.

### Images for distance error tuning:
  - Basically as many images as possible with barrels at known distances away from the robot
    - Ideally at a set of N set distances, uniformally distributed away from the robot at
      any number of random angles around the robot

The error on the distance estimate increases in an exponential factor. The above images will allow that
error to be tracked so it can properly be accounted for in SLAM plotting of final barrel locations.


### Formalised List:
- Strafe square
- Square with 90 on-spot turns at corners
- Footage with the minesweeper "tile" at varying locations (robot can be static - just needs the tile to be put down for a few seconds, then moved to somewhere else for a few seconds, rinse and repeat)
- Footage with the robot static, and a barrel (red or green) placed at known distances (10cm steps) away from the robot, up to a reasonable distance, then again but at a different angle to the robot
